I quickly put together a comaprison of the 3 main R cleaning packages: flowClean, flowCut, and flowAI.

The artificial data is synPerturbed form flowClean and the real data is 220662.fcs from flow repository (FR-FCM-ZZZV)

The code is found in the R script and the outputs are below:
(the strange behaviour of flowCut in the synPerturbed sample is almost certainly to do with the data rather then a problem with flowCut.  I just left it here as I find it amusing)
